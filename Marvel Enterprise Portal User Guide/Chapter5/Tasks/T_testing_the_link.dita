            <p>To test a link you have created:</p>
        </context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>In the source workspace, right-click the location where you created the
                    link.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Click<b> Link To</b> and select the link from the <image
                        href="../Images/I_link.png" width="15" height="15" id="image_bg5_sfc_v1c"/>
                    list. The value of the symbols specified in the link definition are used to
                    select the target workspace and filter its content. An example is a link from a
                    row in a view that includes the <b>Process Name</b>, and the value of Process
                    Name is passed to the target workspace. The view whose symbol was targeted will
                    show information about that particular process.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>If the target workspace does not display what you expected or a Target not
                    found message is displayed, edit the link.</cmd>
                <info>
                    <note id="note_mml_rgc_v1c" type="tip">If you were prompted to select the target
                        workspace but wanted the link definition to be specific so you would not
                        have to choose from a list, do one of two things: If you had chosen Relative
                        as the link type, define a new link and select a link type of Absolute; or
                        make it Dynamic and supply the expression in the target filter to target the
                        specific workspace.</note>
