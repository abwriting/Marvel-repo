                  Portal, you were required to either launch separate browser instances (one
                  for each domain), or use alternate client deployment modes (such as a
                  desktop client or Java WebStart). Minor changes were also made to the Marvel
                  Enterprise Portal for content improvements. New features and capability
                  enhancements were made to the Marvel Management Services. For more
