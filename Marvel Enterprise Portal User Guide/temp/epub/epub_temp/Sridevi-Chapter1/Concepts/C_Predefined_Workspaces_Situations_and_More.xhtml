                     important events because the comparison criteria was set too low, many
                     of the predefined situations for an agent are not set to start
                     automatically. They remain stopped until you either start them manually
                     or set them to <img alt="../../images/I_run_at_startup.png" class="image" id="C_predefined_workspaces_situations_and_more__image_rtd_l53_1yb" src="../../images/I_run_at_startup.png" width="15" height="15" />
                     <span class="ph uicontrol">Run at startup</span>. A good way to find out which
                     situations are set to run at startup and which ones are not, is to
                     filter the Situation editor tree with <img alt="../../images/I_show_situations.png" class="image" id="C_predefined_workspaces_situations_and_more__image_i1g_m53_1yb" src="../../images/I_show_situations.png" width="15" height="15" /> Show Situations, which is available when
                     the Situation editor is opened from the Navigator pop-up menu. As agents
                     report monitoring data, and especially when that data is being collected
                     and stored in a Marvel Data Warehouse, you can better determine the
                     values and circumstances that are worthy of an alert, such as high CPU
                     activity on a transaction server at peak times.</p>
