                           sent to the workspace in the form of chart and table views. You can
                           start monitoring activity and system status immediately with the
                           predefined workspaces. With just a few clicks of the mouse, you can
                           tailor your own workspaces to look at specific conditions, display
                           critical threshold values in red, and filter incoming data so you
