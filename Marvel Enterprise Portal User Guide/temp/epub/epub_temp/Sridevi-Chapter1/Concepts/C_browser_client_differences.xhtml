         <p class="p">Marvel Enterprise Portal can be used with either a desktop or a browser client. For
            a
            desktop client, the application software is installed on your system and you start
            it as
            you would any other application; for a browser client, the application software is
            installed on the web server that is integrated with the Marvel Enterprise Portal Server
            and users log on from their browsers. The software is downloaded to your system the
            first time you log on to Marvel Enterprise Portal, and thereafter only when software
            updates are available.</p>
