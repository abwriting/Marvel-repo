                  information from the data being collected. When you understand what values
                  and states are causing problems, you can refine your views to show what is
                  important. For attribute groups with attributes that can be expressed
                  meaningfully as objects and show their relationship to other attributes in
                  the same group, there is also the <em class="ph i">Relational Table Based</em> topology
                  view.

                     agents have gathered from the systems where they are
                     running.</p>

                  common event, and Marvel Enterprise Console) update automatically to show
                  new events as they arrive and changes in event status as they occur. The
                  graphic view gives you a pictorial alternative to the Navigator for
                  indicating alerts.
                  <p class="p"><img alt="../../images/log.png" class="image" id="C_Types_of_Views__image_akx_hx3_1yb" src="../../images/log.png" width="15" height="15" /> The message log view shows the status of
                     events that have been opened on the entire monitored enterprise and can
                     include up to 100 row entries at a time.</p>

                     situation and policy activities as they happen, such as when a situation
                     has been created or deleted or a policy has been activated.</p>

                     their alerts as icons on a map or a picture to represent your monitored
                     environment.</p>
                  
                  <p class="p"><img alt="../../images/situation%20event.png" class="image" id="C_Types_of_Views__image_s3t_dx3_1yb" src="../../images/situation%20event.png" width="15" height="15" /> The situation event
                     console view shows the status of situation events that have been opened
                     on this branch of the Navigator. The console has a toolbar for quick
                     filtering and a menu for responding to alerts.</p>

                     events from multiple event repositories: Marvel Enterprise Monitoring
                     Server, Marvel Enterprise Console event server, and Netcool/OMNIbus
                     ObjectServer. This view has the same functional capabilities as the
                     situation event console view, such as the ability to sort and filter
                     events.</p>

                     event viewer can integrate events from the Marvel Enterprise Console
                     Server with those from the Marvel Enterprise Monitoring Server.</p>

                     for writing notes or other text that can be saved with the
                     workspace.</p>

                     command to a managed system.</p>
                  
                  <p class="p">

                     session for working with z/OS applications, or a Telnet session for
                     working with the TCP/IP network.</p>

                     browser for accessing web pages.</p>
                  
                  <p class="p">

                     their alerts as icons on a map or a picture to represent your monitored
                     environment. Alerts show on these icons just as they do in the
